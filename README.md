# rice
My juicy rice aka dotfiles.

This is my daily driver linux setup using ```bspwm```:
    - sxhkd (for keybindings)
    - polybar (the beautiful bar)
    - picom (lightweight compositor)
    - kitty (my main terminal emulator)
    - nvim (you know :D)
    - urxvt (second terminal with cool features + w3m support)
    - w3m (for viewing imgs)
    - ranger (cli file manager)
    - rofi (dmenu replacement, great app launcher)
    - dunst (notification daemon)
    - flameshot (great for taking screenshots)
    - qutebrowser (keyboard-focused browser)
